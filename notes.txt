- Remove render from gameobjects, render is done at Screen level and read from
  current Container. Might as replace the sprite getter for a render method
  which links the correct sprite (perhaps from spritesheet) to the screen.

- Add _init method to GameObject, which shoul be overridden to, for example add
  stuff to a scene etc.
